# Release 1.6.1

- Automatic check-out
- List recent data accesses

If supported by the location, you can now optionally enable the automatic checkout. This will register a geo-fence around the location, which triggers the checkout as soon as you leave it.

If a health department accesses data related to one of your recent check-ins for contact tracing, you will now find details about that in the History screen. In addition you will get a notification, even if you're not currently using the app.
